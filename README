This is a (currently) very crude set of tools to make the use of geda a little less painful.

Currently it consists of two tools:
pcbfoot:
	A set of python scripts for generating pcb footprints, currently supporting dil and square smd eg QFN and SOIC - basically anything rectangular with pins along 2 or 4 sides.

ods2trag:
	whilst tragesym is a useful tool, it accepts tab separated .csv files. extracting these from .ods file is a pain where there are lots of devices. ods2trag converts openoffice .ods files to a set of .csv files, one for each table in the .ods file. The idea being that multi-part components can be split into a series of tabs
